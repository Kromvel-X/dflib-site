                <h1>Charts and Dashboards</h1>
                <p>DFLib helps Java programmers to create a few types of data visualizations. The first is
                    <a href="/dflib/docs/1.x/#echarts">visual charts</a> based on DataFrame data. The charts are
                    generated as JavaScript code using the API from Apache Echarts library and can be viewed
                    in Jupyter notebooks or embedded in an HTML page. Additionally, DFLib can generate "dashboards",
                    i.e. full HTML pages with multiple charts based on built-in or user-provided templates.</p>

                <p>Some examples of visualizations (dashboards with charts) that can be done with DFLib:</p>
