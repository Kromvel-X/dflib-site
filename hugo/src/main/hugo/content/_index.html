                    <p>DFLib is a lightweight, pure Java, in-memory DataFrame. It provides a unique data manipulation
                        API that allows to process data incrementally in a highly-composable manner. Unlike "big data"
                        DataFrames, DFLib does not require special infrastructure and can be used in any
                        Java application. Out of the box, DFLib supports loading and saving to CSV, Excel,
                        RDBMS, Avro, Parquet, and JSON formats, and works with a variety of data sources (local filesystem,
                        web services, zip archives, etc.). DFLib is fully open source and is distributed under the Apache
                        License.</p>

                    <p>DataFrame is a 2-dimensional table-like data structure in a programming language with
                        data processing capabilities similar to SQL: filtering, joins, unions, window functions,
                        columns / rows manipulation, and so on. DataFrames are very common in other languages and
                        ecosystems (Python pandas, Spark, R, etc.), but are still quite a rarity in Java.

                    <p>The short answer is "any Java programmer for any data processing task". More specifically, there
                        are two broad categories of use cases. First is data engineering, i.e. building software (often
                        called "data pipelines") to extract and transform data from internal or external sources. ETL,
                        data aggregation, loading Excel files into your database all fall into this category.

                        Second is data analysis that has traditionally been a realm of Python. DFLib
                        opens it up to Java developers. With support for
                        <a href="./dflib/docs/1.x/#jupyter">Jupyter notebooks</a> (based on our own
                        <a href="./jjava/docs/1.x/">Jupyter Kernel</a>), and a
                        <a href="./dflib/docs/1.x/#echarts">charting solution</a>, we provide the entire toolkit
                        needed for interactive and visual data work.

                        with any Java code.

                        Jupyter notebooks or embedded in HTML pages. Additionally, DFLib allows to create
                        <a href="./charts/">full HTML pages with multiple charts</a> (i.e.
                        "dashboards") using built-in or custom page templates.
