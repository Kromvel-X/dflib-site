[#json]
== JSON

Though still somewhat limited, DFLib provides both JSON load and save operations. To start, add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.dflib</groupId>
    <artifactId>dflib-json</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

After that, `JSON` class is the entry point to all operations.
