== Run

This is where the documentation diverges, each environment has it’s own
way of selecting a kernel. To test from command line with Jupyter’s
console application run:

[source,bash]
----
jupyter console --kernel=java
----

Then at the prompt try:

[source,java]
----
In [1]: String helloWorld = "Hello world!"

In [2]: helloWorld
Out[2]: "Hello world!"
----
