== Configuring

Configuring the kernel can be done via environment variables. These can
be set on the system or inside the `kernel.json`. The configuration can
be done at install time, which may be repeated as often as desired. The
parameters are listed with `python3 install.py -h` as well as below in
the list of options.

=== List of options

[width="100%",cols="8%,5%,1%,86%",options="header",]
|===
|Environment variable |Parameter name |Default |Description
|`JJAVA_COMPILER_OPTS` |`comp-opts` |`""` |A space delimited list of
command line options that would be passed to the `javac` command when
compiling a project. For example `-parameters` to enable retaining
parameter names for reflection.

|`JJAVA_TIMEOUT` |`timeout` |`"-1"` |A duration specifying a timeout (in
milliseconds by default) for a _single top level statement_. If less
than `1` then there is no timeout. If desired a time may be specified
with a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html[`TimeUnit`]
may be given following the duration number (ex `"30 SECONDS"`).

|`JJAVA_CLASSPATH` |`classpath` |`""` |A file path separator delimited
list of classpath entries that should be available to the user code.
*Important:* no matter what OS, this should use forward slash ``/'' as
the file separator. Also each path may actually be a
link:#simple-glob-syntax[simple glob].

|`JJAVA_STARTUP_SCRIPTS_PATH` |`startup-scripts-path` |`""` |A file path
seperator delimited list of `.jshell` scripts to run on startup. This
includes
https://github.com/dflib/jjava/blob/main/src/main/resources/jjava-jshell-init.jshell[jjava-jshell-init.jshell]
and
https://github.com/dflib/jjava/blob/main/src/main/resources/jjava-display-init.jshell[jjava-display-init.jshell].
*Important:* no matter what OS, this should use forward slash `/` as
the file separator. Also each path may actually be a
link:#simple-glob-syntax[simple glob].

|`JJAVA_STARTUP_SCRIPT` |`startup-script` |`""` |A block of java code to
run when the kernel starts up. This may be something like
`import my.utils;` to setup some default imports or even
`void sleep(long time) { try {Thread.sleep(time); } catch (InterruptedException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); }}`
to declare a default utility method to use in the notebook.

|`JJAVA_JVM_OPTS` |- |`""` |A space delimited list of command line
options that would be passed to the `java` command running the kernel.
*NOTE* this is a runtime only option, and have no corresponding install
parameter

|`JJAVA_LOAD_EXTENSIONS` |- |`"1"` |Option that controls autoloading Kernel extensions feature.
If you do not want third-party libraries to load anything implicitly you could turn it off by `export JJAVA_LOAD_EXTENSIONS=0`
|===

[#simple-glob-syntax]
==== Simple glob syntax

Options that support this glob syntax may reference a set of files with
a single path-like string. Basic glob queries are supported including:

* `*` to match 0 or more characters up to the next path boundary `/`
* `?` to match a single character
* A path ending in `/` implicitly adds a `*` to match all files in the
resolved directory

Any relative paths are resolved from the notebook serverâ€™s working
directory. For example the glob `*.jar` will match all jars is the
directory that the `jupyter notebook` command was run.

*Note:* users on any OS should use `/` as a path separator.

=== Changing VM/compiler options

See the link:#list-of-options[List of options] section for all of the
configuration options.

To change compiler options use the `JJAVA_COMPILER_OPTS` environment
variable (or `--comp-opts` parameter during installation) with a string
of flags as if running the `javac` command.

To change JVM parameters use the `JJAVA_JVM_OPTS` environment variable
with a string of flags as if running the `java` command. For example to
enable assertions and set a limit on the heap size to `128m`:

[source,bash]
----
export JJAVA_JVM_OPTS='-ea -Xmx128m'
----

or enabled kernel debug:

[source,bash]
----
export JJAVA_JVM_OPTS='-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=5005,suspend=n'
----
